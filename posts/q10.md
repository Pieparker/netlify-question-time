So far, I've really enjoyed the process. Mia is absolutely lovely and fool's honesty and openness was greatly appreciated.

As fool and I discussed, these questions have been around for a while. I respect that you shouldn't fix what isn't broken however, if the needs of the support team evolve, this stage of the process should be revised.
