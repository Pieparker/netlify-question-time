I've used the service before and I wouldn't have used it if it wasn't self-explanatory. However, I do come with a _bit_ of JAMstack knowledge, having worked with GitHub Pages in a personal capacity for a few years.

For a technophobe, the idea of building and deploying a website could be horrendously daunting. God forbid that their build fails because then you're relying on their Google-fu skills to bottom it out.

Take a look at Wordpress... the techie side of things is completely out-of-view. Maybe some sort of 'Easy Builder' wouldn't go a miss with some of the most refined integrations and robust CMS' offered to them. The Netlify Templates page is a good start but, once deployed, users are at the mercy of the template's README file.
