If I'm being honest, I wanted something ready-to-go and [I knew where to find it](https://templates.netlify.com).

I didn't need something CMS-ready; I was more concerned with ensuring that the site wasn't convoluted or showing validation errors. Although a couple of pictures and a favicon might tell you a something about me, I'd rather spend that extra time better constructing my responses.

It may come as a surprise but the biggest challenge when setting up this site was getting the redirect working. I needed to remove my build directory, _site, from .gitignore and get rid of the .txt suffix that my text editor very kindly added for me. D'oh!
