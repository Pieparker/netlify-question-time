If we take a look at my answers to [question one](/posts/q01), I'm ecstatic when I get to the bottom of a really niggly issue. Although it can be quite stressful at the start, it's that stress which carries you through. Not all stress is bad, after all.

Plus, you can reflect on it, share the knowledge and take great satisfaction from being the man-of-the-moment and ensure that other members of the team don't need to endure that same stress for a similar issue.

I think it comes down to understanding how an issue manifested itself and performing the root-cause analysis to prevent recurrence.
