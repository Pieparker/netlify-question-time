I worked closely with the Snipcart team and made use of their [Jekyll e-commerce tutorial](https://snipcart.com/blog/jekyll-ecommerce-tutorial) when I set up my [little side project](https://paradigm.parts).

Firstly, they revisit their tutorials to ensure that they are current, that links work and that referenced dependencies are up-to-date. When the product is up-revved, so are the guides.

The tutorial explains every aspect of the setup, not just adding the cart to a Jekyll website. It explores what the deployed technologies are and how they integrate at a very high level, with some colloquialisms and GIFs thrown in for good measure.

The rest of their guides follow suit too.
