Hey there! Thanks for reaching out.

I'd be happy to help you get your site up and running with us here at Netlify. Firstly, we can take a look at some of the potential quick-fixes. Our [build configuration](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/) guide will talk you through which settings you will need to configure in order for your site to build.

Failing this, if you could provide me with more specific details such as which static site generator you are using, any specific errors you are encountering and any error logs, we can home in on this particular issue.

Thank you!
