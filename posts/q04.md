If I'm being honest, I wanted something ready-to-go and [I knew where to find it](https://templates.netlify.com).

I didn't need something CMS-ready; I was more concerned with ensuring that the site wasn't convoluted or showing validation errors.

Although a couple of pictures and a favicon might give you a bit of an insight, I'd rather spend that extra time better constructing my responses.

The biggest challenge when setting up this site, in all honesty, was perhaps recognising where some crucial metadata was contained within the template! Otherwise, the process has been straightforward.
